const HEAD_PARAGRAPH_MONITUTOR = "Monitoring a public contract is another dimension of civic monitoring that allows you to help make sure that the funds allocated to your community are effectively reaching the people who should benefit from them. Public contracts are a key piece of how public resources are transformed into actual goods, services, or infrastructure that directly affect citizens’ lives. They define the conditions by which selected SUPPLIERS, i.e. companies hired to provide them, are to deliver those goods, services, or works when and where they are needed. <br />At the same time, public procurement is a part of the public administration that is vulnerable to inefficiencies and loss of resources through corruption and fraud, and this can happen in many different ways. For instance, ideally, suppliers are selected through competition to allow public agencies to award contracts under the most cost-beneficial conditions. However, often contracts are awarded in a way that lets someone unduly profit from them. This may be the case if the selection process is deliberately made less competitive to benefit a particular supplier, perhaps a company linked to public officials involved in the selection process. A supplier may also receive the contract at a higher cost than necessary or justifiable. In some cases, problems are observed when the contract is being implemented: the conditions established by the contract are not met by the supplier and those who should benefit from the contracted goods, services, or works receive them in lesser amounts or substandard quality, or in serious cases may not receive them at all.<br />Monithon now allows you to monitor this side of public policy implementation as well. Through the iMonitor initiative, you can access a series of training modules to help you understand basic aspects of public procurement and how it can be manipulated against the public interest. These will show you how to monitor selected contracts on the ground, collect evidence of whether a contract is being correctly implemented or not, and report the problems identified to the right authorities using this reporting tool. This can effectively help identify problems while they can still be remedied, making sure that goods, services, and works are being delivered effectively to citizens.The reporting template includes three parts, following a similar structure as the report for monitoring projects, where you will do your part:<br /><ul><li>Step 1 - Desk analysis</li><li>Step 2 - Contract implementation</li><li>Step 3 - Results and impact</li></ul>Each section has additional instructions on what information can be collected, where and how to collect them, as well as what is most relevant about them and what you should keep an eye out for. The questionnaire covers many aspects of monitoring a contract, but all questions are optional and responses can be edited before the report is submitted. The more information you collect, the better! You can find practical tips for writing your report in our iMonitor Manual: Monitoring Public Contracts.";

To assess this, some basic information from the contract itself and other related documents is important. Key documents may include:<br /><ul>contract;</li><li>contract extensions and modifications (if applicable);</li><li>contract implementation reports;</li><li>payment orders and invoices;</li><li>for construction projects, technical documents (e.g. blueprints, material specifications), and progress reports.</li></ul>Relevant background information on the awarding process may also be useful to gather information on how the supplier was selected. For this, an additional document that may be obtained is the bid evaluation report issued by the tender evaluation committee.<br />These may be accessed through online platforms with public procurement data, or requested by a public information request to the contracting agency or the responsible public procurement authority.<br />Other additional information may be useful too. For example, you can conduct a web search on key terms from the contract description (e.g. construction of a school in district XYZ) and the buyer (e.g. Municipality of XYZ) to find relevant background information on the contract or related project, which helps to understand more about the context of this particular contract and to what policy it is related. This can be reported in Section A: Project/Programme information. In this section, there is also an indication if the contract is linked to a project funded by the EU and where you can find information about it.<br />In Section B: Contract information, by inserting the link to the selected contract on the platform opentender.eu in the corresponding field, basic data on the contract will be automatically imported, including a contract integrity profile. You can edit that information or enter contract details from the contract obtained through the collected documentation or official data. These offer an overview of what the supplier is supposed to deliver, when and at what cost, and also some key conditions for the delivery, as well as whether there have been relevant modifications to those terms, which can sometimes indicate some type of manipulation.<br />Finally, if you want to dig a bit deeper you can also do some research on the supplier and add the information you find in Section C: Supplier information. These cover contact and registration information about the supplier, as well as other relevant information that you may find which could indicate additional corruption risks in how the contract was awarded. If there are subcontractors specified in the contract, you can also look up the same information on them and include them in the report.";

In some cases, a fake supplier (e.g. a shell company connected to a public official or politician) may be awarded the contract and then subcontract the work to the actual supplier while allowing part of the contract value to be diverted.
